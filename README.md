# natural_image_tone_enhancement
An implementation of <b>"Naturalness-Preserving Image Tone Enhancement Using Adversarial Networks"</b> (presented at Pacific Graphics 2019)

# Introduction
This project uses GAN (Generative Adversarial Netowrk) for naturalness-preserving image tone enhancement with an automatically generated paired dataset. The paired dataset consists of input images from Five-K dataset[1] and the results of a previous classical filtering method[2] that produces drastic but possibly unnatural-looking tone enhancement results.

For more details regarding this technique, please refer to the paper

## About Coupe Project
Project ‘COUPE’ aims to develop software that evaluates and improves the quality of images and videos based on big visual data. To achieve the goal, we extract sharpness, color, composition features from images and develop technologies for restoring and improving by using it. In addition, personalization technology through user preference analysis is under study.
